# 8puzzle

Generates a 3x3 matrix filled with random values with one among them being 0 (random position)
Values get shuffled moving 0 to one of the adjacent places each time for a specified number of times

It should then search for the shortest way to get to the shuffled matrix, starting off from the initial one, not knowing the steps followed for the randomized matrix to be generated and following the same condition to move the empty case (move to right, left, or down each time)
